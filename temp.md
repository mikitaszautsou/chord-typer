I want to create an app in python that will intercept user's input and replace with the predefined string in vocabular

for example if user typed t it should be replaced with the
if user typed for example l and then k than lk should be replaced with hello for example
and it should work globally in any application

AI: To create a Python app that intercepts user input and replaces it with predefined strings globally across any application, you can use the `pynput` library. Here's an example implementation:

```python
from pynput import keyboard

# Define the vocabulary mapping
vocabulary = {
    't': 'the',
    'lk': 'hello'
}

# Keep track of the pressed keys
pressed_keys = []

def on_press(key):
    global pressed_keys

    try:
        # Append the pressed key to the list
        pressed_keys.append(key.char)
    except AttributeError:
        # Handle special keys (e.g., shift, ctrl) if needed
        pass

    # Convert the pressed keys to a string
    input_str = ''.join(pressed_keys)

    # Check if the input string matches any vocabulary entry
    for key, value in vocabulary.items():
        if input_str.endswith(key):
            # Remove the matched keys from the pressed keys list
            pressed_keys = pressed_keys[:-len(key)]

            # Simulate backspace to remove the original input
            for _ in range(len(key)):
                keyboard.Controller().press(keyboard.Key.backspace)
                keyboard.Controller().release(keyboard.Key.backspace)

            # Type the replacement string
            keyboard.Controller().type(value)

            break

def on_release(key):
    # Stop the listener when the 'esc' key is released
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        return False

# Create a keyboard listener
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
```

Here's how the code works:

1. We import the `keyboard` module from the `pynput` library, which allows us to monitor and control keyboard events.

2. We define a `vocabulary` dictionary that maps the input strings to their corresponding replacement strings. In this example, 't' is mapped to 'the', and 'lk' is mapped to 'hello'.

3. We initialize an empty list called `pressed_keys` to keep track of the keys pressed by the user.
